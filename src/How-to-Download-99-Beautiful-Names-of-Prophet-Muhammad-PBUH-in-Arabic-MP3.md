## Similarities Between 99 Names of Allah and 99 Names of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH)
  
Some people may wonder why there are 99 names of Allah and 99 names of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and whether there is any connection between them. The answer is that there are some similarities and differences between them.
  
The similarities are:

- Both are based on authentic sources from the Qur'an and Sunnah.
- Both reflect the greatness and perfection of Allah and His messenger.
- Both have benefits and virtues for those who recite them and act upon them.

The differences are:

- Allah has more than 99 names, as He says: "And to Allah belong the best names, so invoke Him by them." (Qur'an 7:180). The 99 names are only a selection of His most beautiful names that He has taught us.
- The Prophet (PBUH) has only 99 names that are unique to him, as he said: "I have five names: I am Muhammad, and Ahmad, and al-Maahi (the eraser) by means of whom Allah erases kufr, and I am al-Haashir (the gatherer) at whose feet the people will be gathered, and I am al-âAaqib (the last)." (Bukhari)
- Allah's names are His attributes that belong to Him alone, such as Al-Khaaliq (The Creator), Al-Aleem (The All-Knowing), Al-Qadeer (The All-Powerful), etc. No one can share or compare with Him in these attributes.
- The Prophet's names are his titles that describe his status, role, mission, or relation to Allah, such as Muhammad (The Praised One), Ahmad (The Most Praiseworthy), Rasool-Allah (The Messenger of Allah), Nabiyy-ur-Rahmah (The Prophet of Mercy), etc. These titles are given to him by Allah or by himself or by others.

Therefore, we should acknowledge the difference between Allah and His messenger, and worship Allah alone without any partners or intermediaries. We should also love and respect the messenger of Allah, and follow his guidance without any deviation or innovation.
